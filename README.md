# beacon

I created this app in 2019 as a part of a startup during university. The apps goal was to find a way to streamline the hosting process for personal events, and create a GUI to see what was happening in the area and who else was in the area.

## Description
I did this by making a standard social media app but gave users and companies the ability to light 'beacons' that have different meanings. \
An orange 'Host beacon' is one that users can create quickly to throw an invite out to their selected groups of friends in a spontaneous and casual way. Similar to FB events but removing the formality and seriousness from an event and making it possible to throw up in seconds. It would also change the inviting method from group chats which can be exclusive to a more open and customised list up to each user. Changing the invite culture to a 'broadcast' like snapchat stories rather than direct messages or group chats. \
A 'Live' beacon is a beacon users can use to show their location to their selected people in an inviting matter. The use case for this was situations where people are out in town but had no idea they had an old buddy in the next bar over. Or for users to know who's keen on doing something for the evening. \
The last beacon is an 'Event beacon' that businesses could use to promote nightlife type of events. There suprisingly isn't an easy way to view what is happening in a city for a given day via a map that isn't cluttered with every type of event. I wanted to shine a light on gigs happening on smaller scales which is sorely missed in social media's current algorithms.

There is a lot more planned for this app including new ways of messaging and group chats.

**At this stage the project is frozen however as other side projects are taking priority and this code base was written rather poorly and is in dire need of a rewrite**
